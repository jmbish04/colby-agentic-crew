## üìù Description

The `colby-agentic-crew` project provides a highly scalable, stateful, and serverless infrastructure for running complex agentic workflows orchestrated by frameworks like CrewAI.

By leveraging the Cloudflare ecosystem, this system ensures low-latency execution, persistent state management via Durable Objects, structured logging via D1, and robust artifact storage via R2, making it ideal for long-running, resource-intensive AI tasks.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Stateful Execution:** Durable Objects (DOs) manage the lifecycle and state of individual agent crews, ensuring persistence and fault tolerance throughout multi-step processes.
*   **Scalability:** Cloudflare Workers handle API requests, automatically scaling to meet demand without requiring traditional server management.
*   **Integrated Data Storage:**
    *   **D1:** Used for structured data, logging crew history, agent performance metrics, and task definitions.
    *   **R2:** Used for storing large outputs, generated reports, images, or datasets produced by the agent crews.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Cloudflare KV provides fast, global access to configuration settings, API keys, and feature flags.
*   **Unified Configuration:** All service bindings and environment variables are centrally managed within the `wrangler.toml` file.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

| Component | Cloudflare Service | Role in Agentic System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Gateway** | Cloudflare Worker | Receives requests (e.g., `POST /start_crew`), handles routing, authentication, and initial validation. |
| **Crew Manager** | Durable Object (DO) | The stateful core. Each DO instance represents a single running CrewAI process, managing its internal state, communication, and task execution lifecycle. |
| **Structured Data** | D1 Database | Stores metadata about crews, detailed execution logs, agent definitions, and user data. |
| **Artifact Storage** | R2 Bucket | Stores final outputs, large files, and intermediate results generated by the agents. |
| **Global Config** | KV Namespace | Stores runtime configuration, LLM API keys, system prompts, and feature toggles accessible by Workers and DOs. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

To deploy and run this project, you will need:

1.  **Cloudflare Account:** Access to the Cloudflare dashboard and API tokens.
2.  **Node.js & npm:** (LTS recommended) for running `wrangler`.
3.  **`wrangler` CLI:** The Cloudflare command-line tool.
    ```bash
    npm install -g wrangler
    ```
4.  **Python Environment:** (If integrating the actual CrewAI logic) While the Worker/DO environment is JavaScript/TypeScript, the agent logic often runs in a subprocess or via an external service triggered by the DO. For local development or testing the agent logic, a Python environment is necessary.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/colby-agentic-crew.git
cd colby-agentic-crew
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Authenticate Wrangler

Log in to your Cloudflare account via the CLI:

```bash
wrangler login
```

### 4. Provision Resources

Before deployment, you must create the necessary resources (D1 database, R2 bucket, and KV namespace) via the `wrangler` CLI or the Cloudflare dashboard.

**Example Provisioning Commands:**

```bash
# Create D1 Database
wrangler d1 create colby-crew-db

# Create R2 Bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create colby-crew-artifacts

# Create KV Namespace
wrangler kv namespace create colby_crew_config
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration (`wrangler.toml`)

The `wrangler.toml` file is the central configuration hub, defining the Worker entry point, environment variables, and crucially, the bindings to all necessary Cloudflare services.

Ensure your `wrangler.toml` is correctly configured with the IDs and names generated during the provisioning step.

### Example `wrangler.toml` Structure

```toml
name = "colby-agentic-crew"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"
workers_dev = true

[vars]
# Example environment variable accessible in the Worker/DO
LLM_MODEL = "gpt-4o"
